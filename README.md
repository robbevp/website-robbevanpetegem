# robbevanpetegem.be

This repository holds the code and content for my personal website. You can see the result at [robbevanpetegem.be](https://www.robbevanpetegem.be).

This setup is based on [Adam Stoddard's Grease template](https://github.com/vampeel/grease), but has cherry-picked the things I need. You're welcome to have a look at the source code and take inspiration for your own projects. All code is released under the hippocratic license.

## Tools used
* Eleventy as static site builder
* Tailwind.css for styling
* NO JS (for now)
* Netlify CMS for content
* Netlify for deployment of the generated site
